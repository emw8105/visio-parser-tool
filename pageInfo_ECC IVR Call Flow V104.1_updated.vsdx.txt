IVR Redesign 
Experience Flows

Version 104.1
4/20/2023

The purpose of this document is to provide users with accurate information on how the IVR experience flows will guide USPS customers through the system allowing them to self-service to a greater extent.








This document is offered as an aid to USPS Customer Care Center staff. As improvement of customer care center operations – through the implementation of new best practices and new technologies – is an ongoing USPS objective, this is a living document that may be updated by the USPS Enterprise Customer Care headquarters to reflect the incorporation of USPS change management updates to content.

Shape ID: 19, Type: Shape, Master = null, Text: Self Service Tag Note:
There could to be multiple End tags for a single Start tag.  For example: a path with Info message played (<ModuleName>-I-E) and the caller also chose to receive an SMS with the info (<ModuleName>-T-E), so this call would have tags: <ModuleName>-S; <ModuleName>-I-E; <ModuleName>-T-E.
Shape ID: 20, Type: Shape, Master = null, Text: Objective and Approach
Call containment is often thought of as the most important IVR metric. It measures the number of calls that begin and end in the IVR system which do not require agent intervention. The call containment rate is the percentage of inbound calls completely handled by the IVR, divided by the number of total incoming calls. 

The objective of the IVR Self-Service Metric Utilization Project (FY2022) is to introduce a new Self-Service Metric which will provide insights into contained call Self-Service utilization.

One contained call can have more than one Self-Service opportunity given the nature of the IVR design.  On the other hand, not every call is meant to be Self-Serviced if it is designed to provide information and connect with a representative.  Hence, it becomes critical to insert tags at the start and end of Self-Service opportunities in modules that can be captured in a report.

Following are different ways customers can Self-Service:
Information – IVR provides targeted messaging to the customer (such as FAQs, announcements or notifications, next steps information).
Text/SMS – IVR sends a text message with the link to USPS.com for Self-Service.
Backend – IVR performs API lookup against several USPS backends (databases) to lookup customer information and provide additional details or status based on the customer’s input (such as Tracking Number, Service Request Number)
Route End – Certain business flows involve navigating from one process to another (such as Tracking-> Service Request Creation, Tracking-> Redelivery).  Route End tag marks a clean exit point of one Self-Service before moving on to a new Self-Service.

That looks like a  U-P-S/United Parcel Service number. Sorry, I am unable to help you with their number on our system and neither can our agents.  
If you are looking to track the USPS shipment, you can find our number at ups.com. The number is located under the shipment detail section after you click “show more”- it is named either Postal Service Tracking ID or Package Identification Code depending on the service selected.
For your reference, Postal Service tracking numbers usually start with 92, 93, 94, or 95 and are 22 or 26 digits long. <pause>
If the number is not listed, US Postal Service does not have any information on the package.
  Now, I can wait while you look for that number at ups.com, just say “Hold”.  To hear this message again, say "repeat".

It is normal for an address to not have any mail slated for delivery on any given day. Or to have mail delivery times fluctuate daily. However, If you have not received any mail at all within a two day period, or if you are not receiving mail regularly for two or more weeks in a row, I can help you with the next steps to get the issue resolved.
Lets get started – If you recently used one of the following services with USPS, please select the applicable service.  Change of Address,
Hold Mail,
Premium Forwarding Service,
Letter Carrier Personnel Issues OR

As we redirect mail to your new address, you can expect it to start arriving within 7 to 10 Postal business days from the Change of Address start date. If your Change of Address request start date is within 10 business days, we recommend that you wait to see if you receive your mail.

You have several options for creating a service request. If you're calling from a smart phone, I can send you a text link to create a service request at USPS.com, just click that link. 
OR
I can take your information in our automated system and submit your service request.
If neither of those options work for you, I can try connecting you with an agent who can help you create a service request. <Pause>
To get started, should I 'Send a link’, <pause> 'Submit a request' .

“The Postal Service has many Post Offices that can accept passport applications on behalf of the US Department of State.  Applications can be obtained online or from a Post Office location that has passport acceptance services. It routinely takes 8 to 11 weeks from when the DEPARTMENT OF STATE receives the application. The cost for a new adult passport book IS $130 application fee and a $35 acceptance fee collected by the U.S. Postal Service. If you are applying in person, you will need to bring a completed UNSIGNED application, proof of US citizenship such as a birth certificate or naturalization papers and submit a photocopy of evidence of citizenship, proof of identity such as government issued ID or driver’s license, and a color photo 2X2 inches in size. Passport photo services may be available at your local Post Office for a $15 fee.  Processing times begin the day the Department of State receives your application at a passport agency or center, not the day you mail your application or apply. All your questions about passports can be answered by visiting the Department of State website at travel dot state dot gov or by calling 1-877-487-2778.

Getting a new passport involves two separate fees.  The cost for a new adult passport book IS $130 application fee and a $35 acceptance fee collected by the U.S. Postal Service. The Department of State application fees are sent in with the application and must be paid by check or money order payable to “U.S. Department of State.” Postal Service passport acceptance fees are paid by credit or debit card, check, cash, or money order. Routine processing takes 8 to 11 weeks from the time of application, including mailing time. Expedited processing takes 5 to 7 weeks including mailing time and requires an additional $60 fee. Passport photo services may be available at your local Post Office for a $15 fee.  You must bring your UNSIGNED completed application to the Post Office.  Please wait to sign your application until requested to do so in person by an authorized agent.

Access the online passport status system to check your application status by going to travel dot state dot gov. or by calling the National Passport information Center at 1-877-487-2778. Only the Department of State can provide passport status.  It may take 2 weeks from the day you apply until your application status is “In Process.” During these 2 weeks, your application is delivered to a mail facility, your payment is processed, and your application is scanned and sent to the Department of State. If your passport status update says, “Not Available,” your application and supporting documents are safely on their way to the Department of State. To hear this message again, press 1. To return to the passport options, press 2.”

“The Postal Service has many Post Offices that can accept passport applications on behalf of the US Department of State.  Applications can be obtained online or from a Post Office location that has passport acceptance services. It routinely takes 8 to 11 weeks from when the DEPARTMENT OF STATE receives the application. The cost for a new adult passport book IS $130 application fee and a $35 acceptance fee collected by the U.S. Postal Service. If you are applying in person, you will need to bring a completed UNSIGNED application, proof of US citizenship such as a birth certificate or naturalization papers and submit a photocopy of evidence of citizenship, proof of identity such as government issued ID or driver’s license, and a color photo 2X2 inches in size. Passport photo services may be available at your local Post Office for a $15 fee.  Processing times begin the day the Department of State receives your application at a passport agency or center, not the day you mail your application or apply. All your questions about passports can be answered by visiting the Department of State website at travel dot state dot gov or by calling 1-877-487-2778. 
To hear this message again, press 1.  To return to the passport option, press 2.”
