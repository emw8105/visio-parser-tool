That looks like a  U-P-S/United Parcel Service number. Sorry, I am unable to help you with their number on our system and neither can our agents.  
If you are looking to track the USPS shipment, you can find our number at ups.com. The number is located under the shipment detail section after you click “show more”- it is named either Postal Service Tracking ID or Package Identification Code depending on the service selected.
For your reference, Postal Service tracking numbers usually start with 92, 93, 94, or 95 and are 22 or 26 digits long. <pause>
If the number is not listed, US Postal Service does not have any information on the package.

That looks like a  U-P-S/United Parcel Service number. Sorry, I am unable to help you with their number on our system and neither can our agents.  
If you are looking to track the USPS shipment, you can find our number at ups.com. The number is located under the shipment detail section after you click “show more”- it is named either Postal Service Tracking ID or Package Identification Code depending on the service selected.
For your reference, Postal Service tracking numbers usually start with 92, 93, 94, or 95 and are 22 or 26 digits long. <pause>
If the number is not listed, US Postal Service does not have any information on the package. 
Now, I can wait up to 3 minutes while you look for that number at ups.com. Once you are back, Press “Re-enter” to try again or  Press Next to come back later. -> SURVEY_FLAG = NO ->

“The Postal Service has many Post Offices that can accept passport applications on behalf of the US Department of State.  Applications can be obtained online or from a Post Office location that has passport acceptance services. It routinely takes 8 to 11 weeks from when the DEPARTMENT OF STATE receives the application. The cost for a new adult passport book IS $130 application fee and a $35 acceptance fee collected by the U.S. Postal Service. If you are applying in person, you will need to bring a completed UNSIGNED application, proof of US citizenship such as a birth certificate or naturalization papers and submit a photocopy of evidence of citizenship, proof of identity such as government issued ID or driver’s license, and a color photo 2X2 inches in size. Passport photo services may be available at your local Post Office for a $15 fee.  Processing times begin the day the Department of State receives your application at a passport agency or center, not the day you mail your application or apply.
